# Recreation

Replacing alcohol as a pressure release is a priority project to allow for longer periods of non-drinking during the year.

The objective is to find a replacement that allows me to relax and blow off some steam without:
1. Knocking me off program for longer than a day
1. Reducing long term harm versus alcohol
1. Reducing calories versus consuming alcohol
1. Preferably something prosocial, or at the very least, that I can enjoy with my partner.

## Potential options
There are several postential options that I can see.
1. THC - in the form of gummies
1. MDMA - very prosocial and good for bonding
1. Psilocybin - may have advantages in promoting brain plasticity

## Experiments

### 24-Nov-2024 No alcohol, half a gummy

In an experiment to replace alcohol as a stress relief I tried going to the B&F Xmas party on a half gummy.

Observations:
- I mixed (probably a mistake) with the other poor quality stuff on hand before we went
- We took the half gummy at 17:30 on the way to the event
- The effect was pleasant, I was happy to be social and was in a good mood
- The effect lasted in the order of 2.5 - 3 hours
- No desire to smoke
- Not morish
- It did not keep me awake, I was feeling tired by 21:30
- I slept reasonably well (Recovery score of 72%), it took in the order of 15 minutes to fall asleep
- Woke up fuzzy headed, required strenious exercise to clear the effects
- No lingering desire to drink the next day, back on program after a sleep

Conclusions:
- I'll need to repeat the experiment to ensure the fuzziness was not the fault of the other substance.
- A reasonably good option, prosocial, slept pretty well, back on program the next day.
- Clearly better than drinking but not without side effects the next day.
