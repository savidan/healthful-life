Retinol
- Actually the stronger stuff is Tretinoin but it is prescription only
- The other option is retinaldehyde

retinaldehyde
- Tretinion is basically pure Vitamin A which causes your skin to increase cell turn over and boost callogen
- Retinol undergoes a transformation after applciation to become retinaldehyde which then converts to tretinion and is used by the skin
- Using retinaldehyde means you are skiping a step in the transform process and is thus more potent
